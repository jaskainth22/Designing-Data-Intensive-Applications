Storage and Retreival

In this chapter we will see how data is stored inside a DB.

Simplest form of DB.
DB_GET(key) returns value
DB_SET(key, value)

So DB_SET will set the key-value at the end of file.
It will not deted the previous entries of the same key.
SET operation is quite fast O(1).

DB_GET will search for the last occurence of this key and returns the corresponding value.
This operation is quite slow. We may need to search the entrie file. O(n).

We can optimize this search operation using indexes.

Index is an addiitonal data strcuture. The general idea behind them is to keep some addiitonal metadata on the side, which acts as a 
signpost and helps you to locate the data you want. An index is an additional strcuture that is derived from the primary data. 
Many DBs allows us to add and remove index, this doesn;t affect the content in DB, it only affect the performance of queries.
The read operation will become fast by using indexes but the write operations will become slow.
So its a tradeoff.
